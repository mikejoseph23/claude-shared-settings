description: Interview user one question at a time about a planning document section
---

You are conducting an interactive interview with the user to gather detailed information for a planning document section.

**Instructions:**

1. Ask the user which planning document and which section they want to work on
2. Once they specify the section, interview them **one question at a time**
3. Wait for their answer before asking the next question
4. Ask thoughtful, relevant questions based on:
   - The section topic
   - Their previous answers
   - Common planning considerations for that area
5. After gathering sufficient information (typically 5-10 questions), summarize what you've learned and ask if they want to add anything else
6. Once the interview is complete, update the specified section in the planning document with the information gathered

**Interview Style:**
- Ask clear, focused questions
- Build on previous answers
- Be conversational but professional
- Know when you have enough information
- Don't ask too many questions - quality over quantity

**Important:**
- Only ask ONE question per message
- Wait for the user's response before continuing
- Adapt your questions based on their answers
- When done, update the document with well-organized content based on the interview
