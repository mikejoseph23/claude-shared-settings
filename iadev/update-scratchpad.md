# Update Scratchpad Progress

Review the @scratchpad.md document and update it to reflect our current progress:

1. **Identify completed work**: Review what we accomplished in this conversation and identify corresponding todo items or sections
2. **Move completed items to bottom**: Create or append to a "## Completed Work" section at the bottom of the document with:
   - Date completed (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Brief description of what was done
   - Any relevant notes or changes made
3. **Remove or check off active todos**: Mark completed items in active sections as [x] or remove them entirely
4. **Update status indicators**: Update phase status markers (✅, ⏳, 📋, ❌)
5. **Update "Next Steps" or top section**: Ensure the top of the document clearly shows what needs to be done next

**Goal**: Keep the scratchpad focused on *remaining* work. Completed work goes to the bottom for later archival into proper documentation. The scratchpad should eventually whittle down to nothing, at which point we'll repopulate it with the next phase from planning docs.

**Structure**:
- Top: Active work, next tasks, current focus
- Bottom: Completed work (to be archived later)
